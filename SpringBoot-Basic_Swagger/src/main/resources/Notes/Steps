We are going to see about swagger in spring boot and how to create documents for
our REST APIs

So what is Swagger?
It is used to generate a document for the rest end-points in our application
because we might create a lot of micro services and we won't be able to
remember each of them

What is the use of Swagger?
--> Quick UI Integration:- suppose we create a micro service and after that i need t
			   send the mail to UI team with some request URL,request body
			   and request response. So based on that, UI team need to need to
			   map from their UIM. If i provide them the donwstream API ie HTML API
			   generated by Swagger then it might be easy for them to integrate quickly.

--> Better Productivity:- Suppose a new resource joins as a part of project, so to understand the
			  flow of our application, he/she can refer the swagger document through which
			  he/she can identify the request url and model which is transferring over the 
			  network

Let's start and see how Swagger genereates the API documentation for us!

1) create all packages.
   Create a class Book with some data fields which is extending Serializable class and also 
   mention the serialVersionUID.
    
2) Create the basic CRUD operations application

3) Now we have got our 5 rest end-points. Each method in controller is an API and we need to 
	generate the rest API document using swagger. To use Swagger, we need to add a dependency.
	
	For Testing purpose,we have only one BookController. Suppose we have 5 controllers and we want 
	to generate the documentation for only 2 controllers, so in this situation we need to inform
	Swagger that only for those 2 Controllers generate the documentation.
	
	So we have to do some configuration for application informing swagger for which APIs we want
	documentation.

4)	Create a class BookConfig and annotate it with @Configuration and @EnableSwagger2.
	So in this class we use Docket, a class provided by Spring framework informing Swagger that we
	want to create a documentation of type Swagger2 with the group name. Also we mention the root
	URL(ie for which URL we need to create the document that we have mention.You'll see the URL in bookcontroller class)
	Below that we the info regarding the application.
	That's it
	
	Now RUN the application!
	
After running, you'll get an error saying that :-
	-->> Cannot invoke "org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.condition.PatternsRequestCondition.toString()".
To make this error free application adding the below line to application.properties :-
			spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy=ant-path-matcher
			
Instead of using POSTMAN to test the application, we can use the HTML page provided by Swagger.
